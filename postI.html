                            <p>It is important that we start at the root of the problem which is the fact that girls’ participation in computer science continuously drops as they grow older. The biggest drop off occurs between the ages 13-17. 66% of girls aged 6-12 are interested/enrolled in computer science programs, whereas the same can be said for only 32% of girls aged 13-17. A large reason for this is due to the gender bias girls face when interested in tech. This, combined with the lack of celebrated women role models in the industry, considerably reduces the female workforce in the tech industry. This also affects women who do make it to the workforce, as the majority feel isolated, discriminated and are more vulnerable to imposter syndrome.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>To combat this, it is import we instill interest and confidence in tech at a young age, and ensure girls remain engaged throughout high school and university, by reinforcing that kids should not be limited by gender bias, celebrate the accomplishments of women currently in tech, emphasize the necessary skills for tech-related jobs, instill confidence by praising the process instead of the outcome, and providing a clear pathway for young girls in tech, all the way from elementary school to the workforce.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>We will partner with Girls Who Code, a not-for-profit organization that aims to close the gender gap in tech.
                              They hold free after-school programs for kids from grades 3 to 12 and provide kids with the opportunity to work on
                              projects that solve real-life problems that they actually care about. Girls Who Code have 30,000 college-aged alumni
                              who are majoring in computer science at a rate which is 15x the national average. What we will do additionally is to
                              provide role models for these kids, so we should partner with local schools to hold events with accomplished women in
                              tech as speakers. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>We will also create university clubs for girls to join after they graduate from high school,
                              to maintain interest in tech. These clubs will aim to create an inclusive community within their
                              university campuses. We will provide mentors and offer campus programs, such as Hackathons, Coding
                              Boot Camps, Networking Events, etc.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Finally, every participant in our school and university programs will have access to our alumni benefits.
                              We will offer scholarships in tech related positions at select universities and provide internship
                              opportunities at our companies. Moreover, alumni will have access to our professional network. </p>
